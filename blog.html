            <p class="title">Use of Relative Size When Styling a Responsive Element</p>
            <p class="date">March 12 2020</p><br>
            <article>

                <p>
                    Responsive web design allows for elements to be automatically changed
                    so that everything fits properly in all types of devices. Responsive
                    elements are able to automatically resize (shrink or enlarge), hide
                    and/or move. This short blog will focus on the pros and cons of using 
                    relative size units in css (%, em, rem) to create an element responsive to its device.
                </p><br>
                    While it is not exactly a requirement or necessary to use responsive elements 
                    in terms of size as most browsers have incorporated zoom features, there are many
                    <a href="https://css-tricks.com/building-resizeable-components-relative-css-units/" target="_blank">benefits</a>
                    to responsive components approach (both at the designer/developer and user-end).
                <p><br>
                <p>
                    A few reasons why responsive elements are beneficial . . .
                    <li> 
                        It is more logical for designers/developers to focus on the sizes of elements 
                        relative to screen size and in proportion to each other rather than in specific size units. 
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        Responsive elements will ensure a site looks well put together on a screen of any size. 
                        They may also ensure that a site is mobile-friendly.
                    </li>
                    <li> Components in the site will always be in proportion. </li>

            <p class="title">The Default 16px Width Font of Browsers</p>
            <p class="date">March 13 2020</p><br>
            <article>

                <p>
                    One may wonder about how browsers interpret custom font-sizes. 
                    In almost every browser, the standard root element font-size is assumed to be 16px.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a result, when one sets a custom font-size, be it 200px or any other size really,
                    the browser interprets that size in terms of the root element size 16px.

            <p class="title">Changes in CSS3</p>
            <p class="date">March 17 2020</p><br>
            <article>

                <p>
                    This blog update will discuss some of the 
                    <a href="http://www.instantshift.com/2017/08/30/know-things-about-implementation-css3/" target="_blank">many changes</a>
                    that have been made in CSS3 briefly by picking the most important ones.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    <b>on Backgrounds, Borders and more:</b>
                    many available options to play with . . .
                    <li>multiple backgrounds - multiple images can be set on the background</li>
                    <li>image border - images can be set as borders</li>
                    <li>rounded corners - new "border-radius" property allows for rounded corners</li>
                    <li>opacity - elements can be made see-through or even completely transparent</li>
                    <li>miscellaneous - new colors and fonts added</li>
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    <b>on Relative Sizing:</b>
                    CSS3 provided designers and developers with the new alternative relative font-sizing units
                    based on viewport dimensions . . .
                    <li>vw - viewport width (1vw = 1% of viewport width)</li>
                    <li>vh - viewport height (1vh = 1% of viewport height)</li>
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    <b>on Grid Layout:</b>
                    CSS3 allows web designers/developers to build a page layout using 
                    a two dimensional system that can deal with both rows and columns . . .
                    <li>explicit grids - area defined with "grid-template-rows" and "grid-template-columns"</li>
                    <li>implicit grids - automatically generated when defined grids are less than actual grids</li>
                    <li>
                        flexible lengths (NEW) - new "fr" unit introduced that allows for free space
                        remaining in the grid container to be viewed when checked
                    </li> 
                    
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    <b>on Flexible Box:</b>
                    As opposed to a box, the flexible box adapts the layout of the page according to 
                    the diverse screen sizes and display gadgets . . .
                    <li>does not use floats (cleaner and simpler in terms of usage)</li>
                    <li>container margin does not fall apart (doesn't depend on margin of information)</li>
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    <b>on Media Queries:</b>
                    designed to inherently support responsive design
                </p><br>
